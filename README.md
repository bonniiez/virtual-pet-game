Deployed game [here](https://bonniiez.github.io/virtual-pet-game/)

Keep your pet alive!

Press the middle icon to hatch your pet fox. Overtime your pet will get hungry, sleep, and poop at random intervals.
You will need to feed and clean up after your pet. 
The user can switch the weather from sunny to rainy using the weather icon. Once the game turns to nighttime,
the pet will sleep and the timer resets. The fox will get hungry upon waking up and the game continues.
If you neglect your pet, it will die and the landscape will switch to the tombstone scene.
Keep your pet alive as long as possible! 

A digital pet game built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 
Motivation for this project is purely for personal educational purposes (i.e.
to learn more about managing application state using state machines, 
and automating code with tools like ESLint, Parcel, and Prettier ).
