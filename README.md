# virtual-pet-game

Deployed game [here](https://bonniiez.github.io/virtual-pet-game/)

A digital pet game built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 
Motivation for this project is purely for personal educational purposes (i.e.
to learn more about managing application state using state machines, 
and automating code with tools like ESLint, Parcel, and Prettier ).
